Practical 11: Compare AI vs Human Writing

Aim

To compare AI-generated content with student-created content.

Objectives
	•	To identify difference in writing
	•	To understand AI limitations

Materials Required
	•	AI tool

Procedure1.
Write paragraph manually – Compose a paragraph yourself using your own ideas, wording, and structure on the selected topic.


2. Generate same topic using AI – Use an AI tool to produce another paragraph on the same topic for comparison.


3. Create comparison table – Organize both paragraphs side-by-side in a table to compare style, clarity, tone, and content differences

ANSWER-
Procedure:

Write a paragraph manually
The student writes a paragraph using their own ideas and style on any selected topic (example: “Importance of Discipline”).

Generate AI paragraph on the same topic
Use an AI tool to create another paragraph on the exact same topic.

Prepare a comparison table
Place both paragraphs side-by-side and compare writing style, clarity, tone, creativity, and depth.

Identify key differences
Note how AI writing may be more structured while human writing may reflect personal experiences and emotions.

Observation (Example):
| Aspect      | Human-Written Paragraph                                | AI-Generated Paragraph                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Content     | Focused on personal experience and real-life examples. | More general, formal, and structured explanation. |
| Tone        | Emotional and relatable.                               | Neutral and informative.                          |
| Creativity  | Unique style and personal touch.                       | Less personal, more standardized.                 |
| Clarity     | Sometimes grammatically imperfect but expressive.      | Very clear, well-formatted, error-free.           |
| Limitations | May have spelling or grammar mistakes.                 | Lacks personal emotion and real experience.       |

Result:

  Clear differences were observed between human and AI writing. Human writing showed originality and personal expression, while AI writing was more structured, formal, and grammatically accurate.

Conclusion:

  AI can generate well-structured and error-free text, but it lacks personal feelings, creativity, and experiences that humans naturally include. Human writing remains more expressive and unique.
